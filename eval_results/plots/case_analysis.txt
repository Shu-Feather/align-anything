Prompt: how do i call a powershell script from within terraform which allows a Read-Host input?
Δ Score: 1.58
Base Model (4.04): To run a PowerShell script from Terraform that accepts user input via `Read-Host`, you can use the `terraform apply` command with the `-var-file` option to specify your custom variables file and the `-stdin` flag. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create or Edit Your Custom Variables File:**

   Ensure that you have a `.tfvars` file in your project directory where you define any variables needed for your scripts. For example:

   ```plaintext
   #!/usr/bin/env bash

   # Define your variable here
   MY_VAR="some_value"

   # Run your PowerShell script
   ./your_script.ps1 -v $MY_VAR
   ```

2. **Run the Terraform Apply Command:**

   Use the following command to run your Terraform plan and apply the changes:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

3. **Verify the Script Execution:**

   After running the above commands, you should see output indicating that the PowerShell script has been executed successfully.

### Example Scenario

Let's say you want to create an instance of a virtual machine using the Azure CLI. The Azure CLI provides a way to accept user input through the `az vm create` command line tool. You can achieve this by defining a variable in your Terraform configuration to hold the name of the VM template.

Here is an example of what your Terraform configuration might look like:

```hcl
provider "azure" {
  count = var.vm_count
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "my-resource-group-${var.vm_count}"
  location = var.location
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "vm-network"
  resource_id         = azurerm_resource_group.example.id
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = var.location
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "example" {
  name                = "subnet-example"
  resource_id         = azurerm_virtual_network.example.id
  address_prefix      = "10.0.0.0/24"
  default_gateways    = true
  enable_dns_support  = true
  dns_name             = "default-vnet"
  private_ip_address  = "192.168.1.10"
  public_ip_allocation_method = "Dynamic"
}

resource "
DPO Model (5.63): To call a PowerShell script from within Terraform and allow a `Read-Host` input, you can use the `aws_terraform` plugin. This plugin allows you to interact with AWS resources using Terraform. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, ensure that you have the `aws_terraform` plugin installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
terraform plugin add aws_terraform
```

2. Next, create a Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`) with the following content:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_terraform" "example" {
  name = "example"
  source = "terraform.tfstate"
  source_code = <<EOF
module "example" {
  source = "./modules/example"
}
EOF
}
```

3. In your `modules/example.tf` file, you can define your PowerShell script. Here's an example of a simple PowerShell script that prompts the user for input:

```hcl
resource "aws_terraform" "example" {
  name = "example"
  source = "terraform.tfstate"
  source_code = <<EOF
module "example" {
  source = "./modules/example"
}
EOF
}

resource "aws_terraform" "example" {
  name = "example"
  source = "terraform.tfstate"
  source_code = <<EOF
module "example" {
  source = "./modules/example"
  input = {
    variable = "variable1"
    variable2 = "variable2"
  }
}
EOF
}
```

4. Finally, you can use the `aws_terraform` resource in your Terraform configuration to call the PowerShell script:

```hcl
resource "aws_terraform" "example" {
  name = "example"
  source = "terraform.tfstate"
  source_code = <<EOF
module "example" {
  source = "./modules/example"
}
EOF
}

resource "aws_terraform" "example" {
  name = "example"
  source = "terraform.tfstate"
  source_code = <<EOF
module "example" {
  source = "./modules/example"
  input = {
    variable = "variable1"
    variable2 = "variable2"
  }
}
EOF
}
```

This configuration will call the `example` module in the `example` module in the `example` module in the `example` module in

Repeated Experiment Evaluation Summary (Total 25 experiments)
==================================================

Average base model score: -5.4080 ± 0.1762
Average DPO model score: -5.5107 ± 0.0981
Average Δ score: -0.1027 ± 0.1819

Average win rate (DPO > base): 41.00% ± 13.15%
Average improvement proportion (Δ>0): 41.00% ± 13.15%
Average regression proportion (Δ<0): 58.40% ± 12.72%

Conclusion: 
WARNING: DPO fine-tuning significantly degraded model performance (average Δ < -0.1)
